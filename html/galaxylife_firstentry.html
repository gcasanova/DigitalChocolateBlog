              <p><span>It was in late 2011</span>, specifically on November 11th, when one of our most anticipated games was released and prepared to get thousands of players to enjoy its adventures. Galaxy Life, became then, one of the greatest achievements of our studio.</p>
              <a href="#openFirstImage"><img class="preview-right" src="../images/galaxylife/advisors_small.png" alt="Starling Mockups"/></a>
              <br>
              <p>The game revolves around a fictional galaxy populated by little orange aliens, our invaluable friends, the Starlings. Like many other multiplayer strategy games, the main goal is to prevail and conquer new worlds.</p>
              <a href="#openSecondImage"><img class="preview-left" src="../images/galaxylife/galaxylife_poster_small.png" alt="Pre-production Galaxy Life Poster"/></a>
              <br>
              <p>A fourteen strong team comprised of programmers, artists, designers and managemenet brought to life Galaxy Life for the Facebook platform. David Germade, one of our senior client programmers, is going to describe the development life cycle behind the project, take it away David!</p>
              <br>
              <p class="columnbreak">“The starting point was Millionaire City. Our intention was to preserve the city building system and the goal, with the addition of stealing resources from other users. This caused that, early in the project, both trade relations between users and battles had the same relevance for the progress of the game.</p>
              <p>We started working in the city building system, without much difficulty, we just had to improve the system already used in Millionaire City.</p>
              <a href="#openThirdImage"><img class="preview-right" src="../images/galaxylife/pillarsofthekings.png" alt="The Pillars of the Starling Kings"/></a>
              <br>
              <p>Meanwhile, our client programmer manager, known admirer of the StarCraft saga, feverishly rushed into hunting for a dream, the development of the ultimate battle engine. The obsession only ceased after long days of frantic typing sessions followed by long catatonic silences, another talent spoiled under the spell of Blizzard, I thought. 
              One morning he collapsed exhausted on top of his keyboard, I went over to check on him and that was the first time I could see, over his dead body, the engine running. I expected to see the work of an abominable tormented mind, but what I saw was a finely tuned symphony of ships, chasing and dodging each other. Ballet, I thought, the old geek has been rehearsing a ballet all this time. The rest of the team approached and immediately excitement spread around the office. A diamond had fallen into our hands. We sent to hell the trade system development and focused on the battles, we just needed to find a right theme that would fit the game but that story was written by the team of artists.”</p>
              <br>
              <p>Indeed it was written by the team of artists at that time but that is another story...</p>
